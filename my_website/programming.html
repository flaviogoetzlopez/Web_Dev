            <h3>The time I fell in love: </h3>
            <p>
                I had never used a computer in my life until the pandemic came, when I was in the urgent need to  learn how to use one.
                I quickly learnt the basic functionality, and I discovered that they could be very fun, and I got interested in how they worked.
                I decided to learn a Programming Language by my own, because my school didn't have  an informatics curriculum at that time. 
                Since that moment, I have been fascinated by them, and always keen to learn more about them.
                That is the reason why I am going to study Computer Science in a University, and have taken a lot of tutorials online and done a lot of projects of my own.

                <p>
                    I have got a deep Python understanding, and have taken multiple courses on it. I am currently taking
                    the free online Harvard Course CS50 AI with Python. I am very familiar with the syntax, to the point
                    that I would be confortable coding without any assistance from Google. I have got many small projects, this is a list of some of them:

                    <p>
                        One project which I decided to take on, was to write a programm, which can see a camera input, 
                        interpret how the Rubik's cube is structured and give you a clear sequence of steps which need to be 
                        followed to solve the cube. The Programm <a href="assets/files/cube_image.py">cube_image.py</a>
                        takes care of the image processing while the programm 
                        <a href="assets/files/rubix_cube_loesen.py">rubix_cube_loesen.py</a> 
                        takes care of the steps to solve the cube and the visual output window.

                    I programmed this programm which calculates the Binomial Distribution for my Math class, 
                    and then showed it to my Math teacher, he liked it very much.

                During the pandemic, and the time of online clasess, the time when I started programming, 
                I wanted to practice my skills with 
                useful projects, so I decided to code a programm to get me into every days classes.

                Learning how to use the Pygame python module, I practiced on some basic projects, amongst them was 
                a game of Tetris. <a href="assets/files/tetris.py"> tetris.py</a>

                    There is a private German organization called "Games Talente" which organizes a contest yearly, 
                    where people can submit Video-Games, and the best ones, get chosen for a workshop going on for a week. 
                    I submited the following Video Game (in german) written in Python code with Pygame, and they accepted me. 
                    It was a great week and I learnt a lot. <a href="assets/files/Games_Talente_Projekt.py">Games_Talente_Projekt.py</a>
