                        Since I was seven years old I practiced Tennis Mondays Wednesdays and Fridays, I got good at 
                        the sport and often played against my peers, but when I moved to Germany in September 2021 I 
                        wasn’t able to continue playing, because there were no courts available to me.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        One of my 2021's new year’s resolutions was to climb the Mountain in my City at least once a Week for 
                        an entire year, but at that time I already knew that I wanted to go to Berlin, so I decided that if I made
                        it to Berlin, it would only count while I was living in Venezuela. At the end I managed to go for 36 weeks 
                        straight.

                        When I arrived in Germany I started practicing Kickboxing for about one year, but I always had a Headache 
                        after the lessons, so I stopped because I felt I could get an injury.

                        I Bike to school listening to music every day, it is a commute of 5km 
                        which takes me about 15 Minutes. I have a distance tracker on 
                        my Bike, and from September 15, 2021 to September 15, 2022, I have ridden
                         the Bike for at least 1700 kilometers.
